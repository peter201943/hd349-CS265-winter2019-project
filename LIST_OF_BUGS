BUG 1:

If a file has two colons, it will mess up the delimiter for awk.

You need to get all indexes 1 through infinity, and use all of them.

BUG 2:

We lack good testing data. We need to test tags that also have that tag inside as a string.

Like :

DESCRIPTION:DESCRIPTION:Hi there!

Should give

KEY = DESCRIPTION
Value = DESCRIPTION:Hi there!
