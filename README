	Description
Ical Converter (icalconv) takes an .ics file and converts it into an html table.
To build icalconv for your system, run, "make icalconv" or, "make all" from within the ical directory.

This will create an executable bash script called icalconv in your ical directory. To use icalconv, call icalconv
with, "./icalconv ICS_FILE".

As part of the build procedure, icalconv will generate two test files. If no errors are detected, the files are deleted.
If a error occurs, the files are retained and a message should be echoed, notifying you of the exception.

	Technical
Ical Converter uses these scripts in this order:
	clean_ics.sh | wget_remove.sh | get_table_headers.sh | pad_empty_fields.sh | generate_html.sh
Here is a brief overview of each script:
	clean_ics.sh
Finds and removes and VAlarms or VEvents and removes them from the ics file. Generates clean_out_2.ics
	wget_remove.sh
Finds and removes any urls from the ics file. Generates clean_out_3.ics
	get_table_headers.sh
Builds a list of html headers based on the headers in the ics file. Depends on get_table_headers.awk
	pad_empty_fields.sh
Pads out any missing fields in the headers list.
	generate_html.sh
Constructs the final html file. Depends on generate_html.awk
