	Description
Ical Converter (icalconv) takes an .ics file and converts it into an html table.
To build icalconv for your system, run, "make icalconv" or, "make all" from within the ical directory.

This will create an executable bash script called icalconv in your ical directory. To use icalconv, call icalconv
with, "./icalconv ICS_FILE".

As part of the build procedure, icalconv will generate two test files. If no errors are detected, the files are deleted.
If a error occurs, the files are retained and a message should be echoed, notifying you of the exception.

	Usage
"./icalconv target_ics_file" or "./icalconv www.target_website.com/target_ics_file"

	Technical
Ical Converter uses these scripts in this order:
	clean_ics.sh | wget_remove.sh | get_table_headers.sh | pad_empty_fields.sh | generate_html.sh
	
Here is a brief overview of each script:

	clean_check.sh
	Compares a known clean ics file with a processed messy one. Used for testing purposes within makefile.

	clean_ics.sh
	Finds and removes and VAlarms or VEvents and removes them from the ics file. Generates clean_out_2.ics

	wget_remove.sh
	Finds and removes any urls from the ics file. Generates clean_out_3.ics

	get_table_headers.sh
	Builds a list of html headers based on the headers in the ics file. Depends on get_table_headers.awk

	pad_empty_fields.sh
	Pads out any missing fields in the headers list.
	
	generate_table.sh
	Arranges the headers list with a content list and populates a calendar structure. Depends on generate_table.awk.

	generate_html.sh
	Constructs the final html file. Depends on generate_html.awk

	makefile
	Builds all of the individual scripts into a single script named icalconv.
	
We will now go into more detail on each script's behavior and usage. All scripts are located within the, "scripts," directory, and all testing files are located within the, "test," directory.

	clean_check.sh
Utilizes diff to compare a known clean ics file with a messy one which is processed during the test procedure of the makefile.
Can be invoked out of makefile with "./clean_check.ics your_ics_file"

	clean_ics.sh
Utilizes a while loop and sed to remove nasty valarms and vevents. These pests are common in ics files and do not translate well to html tables, so we find and eliminate any instances of them. The target ics file is loaded into a temporary ics file (clean_out_2.ics) and in place sed calls are made to remove offending lines. clean_ics.sh is called during the build procedure of the makefile.

	wget_remove.sh
Utilizes grep and sed to remove any urls, complete or broken, from the target ics file. Changes are saved to a temporary ics file (clean_out_3.ics). Offending lines are saved to a list, and the list is processed by sed to eliminate them from clean_out_3.ics

	get_table_headers.sh
Calls get_table_headers

	pad_empty_fields.sh

	generate_table.sh

	generate_html.sh

	makefile
