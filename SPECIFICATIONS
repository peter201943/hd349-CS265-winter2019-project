	Goals
The icalconv should be an easy to use, command line utility supported on most POSIX-compliant systems. icalconv should support local or Internet located files. icalconv has a testing suite which should enable users to detect build errors and report them as needed. The project is modular through the development of several small, independent scripts (wherever possible), so as to facilitate debugging and end-user customization. The final HTML file generated by icalconv should be readable by popular Internet browsers.
