* General Info
 - Peter Mangelsdorf
 - Henry Dang
 - 11 February 2019
 - CS 265
* Techinques
 - Using AWK language
 - Take blocks between vevent
 - File is assumed valid
 - File follows specific format - Google format
 - vevent and vecalendar
 - vevent - individual events - alarms, etc. do not want
 - need to format dates to readable format with regex
 - separated by "t"
 - ignore all other tags
 - convert to an html table - esp. headers
* Ideas
 - Read through entire file
 - cut out only needed events
 - save needed some to temporary file on disk
 - look through unique fields and headers
 - use an awk dictionary trick - see mongan's example
 - Then create html table headers - loop through
 - go through file once more, check for headers, if none exist add it
 - Need to check for each field, if dne, put nothing
 - Only 1 argument - website link
 - Needs make file, run on cli
* Implementation
 - Test files
 - 1 ideal
 - 1 awful - use to check that v alarm is skipped over
 - Tags can be nested inside other tags
 - Primarily newlines, semicolons, and capital letters
 - Beware special characters: . , / \ | :
* Further Readings
 - ical's - limited tutorials
