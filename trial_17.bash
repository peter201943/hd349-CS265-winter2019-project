#Peter's Wild plan to build a neural network command line chatbot.
#
#OK, here's the plan: have a program called "askpeter" which runs in the bacground. Users can type "ask" and then "string". The program parses the string and searches a static neural netowrk for the best hits. It then returns a list of links to the readings it found. The links can be clicked on and the files opened via pager.
